This project focuses on improving the point-of-sale (POS) systems used in retail stores. 
In many retail environments, when a customer wishes to return a product, the store requires the original receipt. 
Typically, store employees will either physically mark the receipt or retain it completely to process the return. 
Our solution, handleReturn, introduces an innovative approach to this procedure by digitally storing and managing the return processes within the system. 
This alternative method streamlines returns, enhances efficiency, and provides a more seamless experience for both customers and staff.
